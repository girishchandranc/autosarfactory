# Autosar Modelling Tool
AutosarFactory provides nice methods to read/create/modify AUTOSAR compliant arxml files. The folder `autosarfactory` contains the autosarfactory implementation with respect to the schema corresponding to the latest AUTOSAR release. Please check the folder `autosar_releases` for previous AUTOSAR releases

## How to use
- Clone the repository.
- Manually install the package.
    
    $ python setup.py install
> use `python3` if you have both `python2` and `python3` installed.

- Import the package `autosarfactory` to your python script.
- And, finally have fun with modelling AUTOSAR.

### Reading file
```python
#Read a list of files
files = ['component.arxml', 'datatypes.arxml']
root, status = autosarfactory.read(files)

#Read a list of folders
folders = ['folder1', 'folder2']
root, status = autosarfactory.read(folders)

```
The read method processes the input files/folders and return the root node(with merged info of all the files). If folder is provided, the method does a deep search for the arxml files and reads in all the files in the folder. The status gives an info if the file/folder reading was successful.

### Creating new file
```python
newPack = autosarfactory.new_file('newFile.arxml', defaultArPackage = 'NewPack')
```
Creates a new arxml file with the given package name and returns the ARPackage object.
- If package name is not provided, default package name 'RootPackage' is used. 
- The method raises FileExistsError if the given file already exist. To avoid this, please pass the argument overWrite as True.

### Accessing attributes and references
Model elements have `get_<attribute/reference>` methods to access existing attribute and reference value.
> For multi-references, the method returns a list of values

### Modifying attributes/references
All the elements have `set_<attribute/reference>`methods to modify the attribute or reference value.
> For multi-references, there also exists methods `add_<reference>`, `remove_<reference>`

### Adding new model elements
All the parent classes have `new_<element>` methods to create an element.
```python
rootPack = autosarfactory.new_file('newFile.arxml', defaultArPackage = 'RootPack')
newPack = rootPack.new_ARPackage('NewPack')
#new applicaton component
asw1 = newPack.new_ApplicationSwComponentType('asw1')
asw1.new_PPortPrototype('outPort')

#new senderRecever interface
srIf = newPack.new_SenderReceiverInterface('srif1')
srIf.new_DataElement('de1')
```
### Accessing elements by path
Once the file is read by the tool, its possible to access elements by path.
```python
files = ['component.arxml', 'datatypes.arxml']
autosarfactory.read(files)
swc = autosarfactory.get_node('/Swcs/asw1')
uint8DataType = autosarfactory.get_node('/DataTypes/baseTypes/uint8')
```

### Saving options
#### Save
The tool provides `save` method to save the changes made to the model.
```python
files = ['component.arxml', 'datatypes.arxml']
autosarfactory.read(files)

rootPack = autosarfactory.new_file('newFile.arxml', defaultArPackage = 'RootPack')
newPack = rootPack.new_ARPackage('NewPack')

#new applicaton component
newcomp = newPack.new_ApplicationSwComponentType('newcomponent')
newcomp.new_PPortPrototype('outPort')

#new senderRecever interface
srIf = newPack.new_SenderReceiverInterface('srif1')
srIf.new_DataElement('de1')

#save changes
autosarfactory.save(['newFile.arxml'])
```
The `save` method accepts a list of file which needs to be saved. If no argument is provided, all the files(input, newly created) will be saved.

#### SaveAs
The tool provides `saveAs` method to save the changes made to the model into a single arxml file.
```python
files = ['component.arxml', 'datatypes.arxml']
autosarfactory.read(files)

rootPack = autosarfactory.new_file('newFile.arxml', defaultArPackage = 'RootPack')
newPack = rootPack.new_ARPackage('NewPack')

#new applicaton component
newcomp = newPack.new_ApplicationSwComponentType('newcomponent')
newcomp.new_PPortPrototype('outPort')

#new senderRecever interface
srIf = newPack.new_SenderReceiverInterface('srif1')
srIf.new_DataElement('de1')

#save changes
autosarfactory.saveAs('mergedFile.arxml')
```

### Export element
The tool provides `export_to_file` method to export a specific element to a file including it's AR-Package hierarchy. This is only supported for CollectableElements(which means AP-Package as well as all PackageableElements which includes ApplicationSwComponentType, SR interface, Signals etc etc- precisely any elements which directly fall under an AR-Package)

- option1(using export function available in the node itself)
```python
autosarfactory.read(['component.arxml'])
swc = autosarfactory.get_node('/Swcs/swc1')
swc.export_to_file('swc1Export.arxml', overWrite = True)
```
- option2(using export function where the node is passed)
```python
autosarfactory.read(['component.arxml'])
swc = autosarfactory.get_node('/Swcs/swc1')
autosarfactory.export_to_file(swc, 'swc1Export.arxml', overWrite = True)
```

### Autosar visualizer
The package also includes a graphical visualizer for the Autosar models which can be simply opened by passing the autosar root to the method `show_in_ui`.
For example:
```python
files = ['component.arxml', 'datatypes.arxml']
root,status = autosarfactory.read(files)
autosar_ui.show_in_ui(root)
```

Please see below a screenshot of the visualizer.

The visualizer mainly consists of 4 views and a menu bar.
- Autosar Explorer - A simple tree which shows all elements in the model.
- Property view - Info about property and its corresponding values of the selected element in autosar explorer.
- Referenced by view - This views list elements which references the selected element in autosar explorer.
- Search view - Provision to search any elements in the model. The type of search can be selected through a combobox at the top of the view. There are 3 different types of search available: by the element short name, by a regular expression applied to the name of the element or by the Autosar type of the element.

The menu bar allows to switch the theme applied to the application at runtime and to exit the application. (This is planned to be extended with new menu options added in the future).

## Examples
Please check the script inside the `Examples` folder which creates a basic communication matrix. 

For more information on the usage, please refer `tests/test_autosarmodel.py`.
